## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Integer cents throughout — `parseCents`/`formatCents`/`splitCents` with largest-remainder; no floating point in domain logic
- [Init]: File System Access API + IndexedDB fallback for persistence; no backend, no server
- [Init]: Two modes (Stabilize/Distribute) auto-detected from state — never a manual toggle
- [Init]: Vite 7 + React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui (New York) + Zustand 5 (no persist middleware)
- [Init]: Allocation engine (`domain/allocationEngine.ts`) must have zero React imports — pure TS, testable in Node

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 6]: Anthropic browser API CORS policy is LOW confidence — verify `anthropic-dangerous-direct-browser-access` header behavior before writing any AI integration code. May need lightweight proxy if direct browser access is blocked.
