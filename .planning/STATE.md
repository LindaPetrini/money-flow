# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-27)

**Core value:** When an invoice lands, tell the user exactly where every euro goes — so they never have to think about it in the moment.
**Current focus:** Phase 3 — Core UI (complete)

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 7 (Core UI) — COMPLETE
Plan: 4 of 4 complete in current phase (03-01 bootstrap/seed, 03-02 dashboard, 03-03 invoice, 03-04 navigation)
Status: Phase 3 complete — three-tab navigation shell wired; app usable end-to-end
Last activity: 2026-02-28 — Phase 3 Plan 04 executed (three-tab navigation, HistoryPage placeholder)

Progress: [████████░░] ~55% (phases 1+2 complete, phase 3 fully done)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: ~15 min
- Total execution time: 0.75 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 Foundation | 3 | 0.75h | ~15min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (scaffold), 01-02 (TDD cents), 01-03 (storage/stores)
- Trend: On track

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 02-allocation-engine P03 | 10 | 2 tasks | 2 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Integer cents throughout — `parseCents`/`formatCents`/`splitCents` with largest-remainder; no floating point in domain logic
- [Init]: File System Access API + IndexedDB fallback for persistence; no backend, no server
- [Init]: Two modes (Stabilize/Distribute) auto-detected from state — never a manual toggle
- [Init]: Vite 7 + React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui (New York) + Zustand 5 (no persist middleware)
- [Init]: Allocation engine (`domain/allocationEngine.ts`) must have zero React imports — pure TS, testable in Node
- [Phase 02-allocation-engine]: Buffer deficit used for mode detection only — no buffer top-up move generated in v1
- [Phase 02-allocation-engine]: Empty overflowRatios produce an unallocated move rather than silently dropping cents
- [Phase 03-core-ui 03-01]: overflowRatios.length === 0 used as proxy for unconfigured settings in seedIfEmpty (not taxAccountId)
- [Phase 03-core-ui 03-01]: seedIfEmpty placed after Promise.all store load so initialized guards pass before any writes
- [Phase 03-core-ui 03-02]: AccountCard receives onBalanceChange as prop rather than calling useAccountStore directly — keeps card pure and testable
- [Phase 03-core-ui 03-02]: Status thresholds — at-target >=100%, near-target >=80%, below-target <80% of targetCents
- [Phase 03-core-ui 03-04]: Plain button-based tab nav over shadcn Tabs — avoids new component dependency for a simple two-state toggle
- [Phase 03-core-ui 03-04]: Dashboard uses default export; InvoicePage uses named export — App.tsx imports adjusted accordingly

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 6]: Anthropic browser API CORS policy is LOW confidence — verify `anthropic-dangerous-direct-browser-access` header behavior before writing any AI integration code. May need lightweight proxy if direct browser access is blocked.

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-02-28
Stopped at: Phase 3 Plan 04 (03-04) complete — three-tab navigation shell, HistoryPage placeholder; build passes, all 75 tests pass.
Resume file: None

### Execution Notes (Phase 1)
- vitest upgraded to v3 (v2 had type conflicts with vite v7)
- Used separate vitest.config.ts (not inline in vite.config.ts) to avoid plugin type conflicts
- FSA API types added via src/types/fsa.d.ts (not in TS lib.dom.d.ts yet)
- passWithNoTests: true in vitest config (needed before test files exist)
